### Step 1: Identifying Libraries

## Python libraries:

- socket: To create connections and interact with ports.
- scapy: For ARP and ICMP scanning, and for crafting network packets.
- argparse: For handling command-line arguments.
- threading or asyncio: To make the scanner faster by scanning multiple ports concurrently.
- logging: For logging functionality.
- Make sure to install any required libraries using pip install scapy argparse logging.

### Step 2: Learning ARP and ICMP Protocols

- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) helps resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to send error messages or perform simple network diagnostics, like pinging.
**Both protocols will help in detecting active hosts on the network**

### Step 3: Learning TCP SYN Scans

A TCP SYN scan sends SYN packets to a range of ports and waits for a response. 
If a port responds with SYN-ACK, it’s open. If it sends RST (reset), the port is closed. 
You can use Scapy to create and send these packets.

### Step 4: Implementing the Scanner Code
Here’s a simplified version of a port scanner:

### Step 5: Testing on Localhost and Remote Host
Test your port scanner on both localhost and a remote host. The remote host should be within the same subnet or a VM environment.

### Step 6: Error Handling and Input Validation
Ensure the host and port range inputs are validated.
Handle socket timeouts and connection errors gracefully.

### Step 7: Ethical Considerations
Always get permission before scanning a network.
Limit your scans to avoid overwhelming the target network (rate limiting can help here).

### Step 8: Detection of Port Scanning
Port scanning detection can be achieved through various network monitoring tools (like Snort or Wireshark) that alert when suspicious traffic patterns are detected, such as repeated SYN requests to multiple ports.
